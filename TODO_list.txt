==========

1) harmonise standards for control printouts
    -- introduce sterring arg.DEBUG (?)
    -- used "print" "write", "msg service"

2) plotting scripts better configurable
   for directories of input/output
   automatize 

3) understand code+formulas for loss function in case of "soft"

4) multi-class --> two class
   can we quantify better differences/similarities of performance
   which approach does what?

5) oracle-predictions for multi-class, how to define

6) better statistical quantification for multi-class performance

==========

1) Added a1rho and a1a1 channels, but not yet configured well.
   Have to introduce redundant cpmix_utils.py download_data.py
   because file names are not configurable.

2) Problem with
     -- a1rho: Variant-2.0, Variant-2.1  >  nan from loos function
     -- a1a1: still cannot configure loading data

3) I would like to have more structured project:
      HiggsCP/main.py
      HiggsCP/src_scripts/xxx.py
      HiggsCP/anal_scripts/yyy.py
      
   how to tell in python directory where the source is?

4) not clear why it is not working today

   python main.py -e 5 -t nn_a1rho -i A1RHO_DATA -f Variant-4.1 --num_classes 2

   environmental variable $A1RHO_DATA is fine, still cannot find data, should not
   be trying to donwload them. Looks that args.IN is not propagated correctly by the
   os system. Is not understanding that should use $A1RHO_DATA and not A1RHO_DATA

5) add rafjoz@gmail.com  for pull/push rights into erichter branches

6) clean up for calculating features of Variant-2X and Variant-3X families if not used,
   clean up also for: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in sqrt

7) for plotting metrics (anal_scripts), horizontal axes do not represent number of classes,
   but the stacking count. How to convert?

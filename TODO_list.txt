==========

1) harmonise standards for control printouts
    -- introduce sterring arg.DEBUG (?)
    -- used "print" "write", "msg service"

2) plotting scripts better configurable
   for directories of input/output

3) understand code+formulas for loos function in case of "soft"

4) multi-class --> two class
   can we quantify better differences/similarities of performance
   which approach does what?

5) oracle-predictions for multi-class, how to define

6) better statistical quantification for multi-class performance

==========

1) harmonise standards for control printouts
    -- introduce sterring arg.DEBUG (?)
    -- used "print" "write", "msg service"

2) plotting scripts better configurable
   for directories of input/output

3) understand code+formulas for loss function in case of "soft"

4) multi-class --> two class
   can we quantify better differences/similarities of performance
   which approach does what?

5) oracle-predictions for multi-class, how to define

6) better statistical quantification for multi-class performance

==========

1) Added a1rho and a1a1 channels, but not yet configured well.
   Have to introduce redundant cpmix_utils.py download_data.py
   because file names are not configurable.

2) Problem with
     -- a1rho: Variant-2.0, Variant-2.1  >  nan from loos function
     -- a1a1: still cannot configure loading data

3) I would like to have more structured project:
      HiggsCP/main.py
      HiggsCP/src_scripts/xxx.py
      HiggsCP/anal_scripts/yyy.py
      
   how to tell in python directory where the source is?

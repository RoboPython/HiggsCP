Multi-class classification:

  --> for presentation of results write folliwng script
      --> unweight events to mixing angle alpha=0.2, 0.5, 1.0
      --> for such events plot distribution of predicted weights
          as a function of mixing angle angle
      --> should observe peak at  alpha=0.2, 0.5, 1.0
